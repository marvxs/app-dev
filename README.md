Naruto has a lot of broken heroes, a lot of them have taken a path where the world sees them as a villain. Their true objective is peace, but the way of they're doing it is not humane and selfish. Obito Uchiha is one of my favourite broken hero. What i like the most about the series is they had shown to us that peace can be obtained through sincere talk to one another. This was done by Naruto, which he uses his "Talk no Jutsu" and convinced the broken heroes from the series why they are wrong and actually bringing them along the right path.
